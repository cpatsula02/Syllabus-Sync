You are reviewing a university course outline to evaluate whether it meets institutional standards based on a checklist of required elements.

For each checklist item provided below, determine if the **course outline contextually satisfies the requirement**, even if the exact wording or heading is not present. Look for alternative phrases, paraphrased sections, embedded tables, or implied meaning.

Return one of the following for each item:
- **"Yes"** – The requirement is clearly addressed, even with different formatting or phrasing.
- **"No"** – The requirement is clearly missing or absent from the document.
- **"N/A"** – The requirement does not apply to this specific course (e.g., no final exam listed).

After each response, provide a **brief justification** (1–2 sentences) explaining your reasoning and referencing the relevant content if possible.

### Checklist Items:
1. Instructor email is included and contains the domain “ucalgary.ca” (including subdomains like haskayne.ucalgary.ca).
2. Course objectives or learning outcomes are listed and structured, even if not labeled “objectives.”
3. Readings, textbooks, or other materials are listed anywhere in the document.
4. A policy or description is included about tools or platforms that students can or cannot use (including generative AI).
5. The workload or weekly effort expectations are described, even if the term “workload” is not used.
6. A grade scale is shown, mapping percentages to letter grades.
7. Each assessment has a percentage weight toward the final grade.
8. If group work is listed, it is 40% or less of the total grade; if no group work exists, mark as N/A.
9. Each assessment links to at least one course objective/outcome, or that mapping is described elsewhere.
10. Due dates for assessments are included in the table, assignment section, or schedule.
11. At least 30% of the grade is earned before the last class; this can be confirmed by dates and weights.
12. No assessments or deliverables are scheduled after the final class or final project date.
13. A missed assessment policy is included, even if not labeled that way (keywords: deferral, illness, make-up work).
14. A late policy is described, including penalties or grace conditions.
15. If participation is graded, the outline explains how it’s evaluated (e.g., discussion, professionalism).
16. Assignment instructions include how and where to submit (e.g., via D2L, not email).
17. If there is a group project, the outline includes the first due date and project expectations.
18. If there is a midterm or quiz, timing, location, tech needs, and allowed items are described.
19. If a final exam exists, it meets the same conditions as above and counts for no more than 50%.
20. If a take-home final exam is mentioned, it is flagged for admin review; if not, mark as N/A.
21. A section describes how to contact the instructor, or contact instructions are clearly presented.
22. A class schedule or session breakdown is included with dates and topics.
23. Assessment due dates are listed or referenced in the schedule.
